## Contributing

- Clone the repo
- Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-rules`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add my new rules'`
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-rules`

Just make sure to follow the existing structure and add your `.cursorrules` file with the correct information. Make sure to include the author name at the end of the `README.md` file in your new directory.

Be conscise and descriptive when naming the your new directory, use snake case and add the language and framework at the end of the directory name, if applicable.

If your rules are similar to an existing one but you want to add something new, don't hesitate to create a new rules file.

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch.

Thanks for your contribution!
